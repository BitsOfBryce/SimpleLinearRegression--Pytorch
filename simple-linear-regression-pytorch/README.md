# Simple Linear Regression with PyTorch

Hey yall! This is a basic linear regression model built using PyTorch. It generates a simple dataset and teaches a model to fit a line of the form y = 2x + 3, with a little bit of random noise added in.
The purpose of this project is to get some practical experience with machine learning using PyTorch.

## What I Learned

Working on this project, I got some hands on practice with PyTorch and finally saw how a basic machine learning model actually learns from data. I learned how to set up a neural network, define a loss function, and use an optimizer to train the model. It was cool to see how the loss goes down with each training step, and how the modelâ€™s predictions get closer to the real data. This project also helped me get more comfortable with the typical machine learning workflow, including building the model, training it, and visualizing results.

## How to Run

```bash
pip install torch numpy matplotlib
python linear_regression_pytorch.py
